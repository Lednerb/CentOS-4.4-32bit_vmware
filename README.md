# CentOS 4.4 32-bit vmware image

This is a fresh installed version of CentOS 4.4 32-bit, packed as a vmware image, with the following configuration:

- user: `vagrant:vagrant`, added to `sudoers` file
- root: `root:vagrant`
- optimized `yum` repository: http://archive.kernel.org/centos-vault/4.4/
  (`yum install` works)



I've needed this image for compiling exploits and had to install it manually because no ready to use image was available.

Feel free to use it for your purposes.
